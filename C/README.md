# Item Collect #

An ncurses example using C.  

## Description ##

It's a fairly pointless games where you use the arrow keys to navigate the person to collect items and score points.   It demonstrates basic UI input handling with curses in C.  It also automagically adjusts is the terminal screen is resized.

## How to install ##

This depends on ncurses, so you'll need to install ncurses-devel (or equivalent) to compile.

To compile:

```$ make```

## To run ##

Just run the binary `$ ./item-collect` created in the previous step in a terminal.  Nothing special.
